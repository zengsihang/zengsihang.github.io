This is my personal webpage. My full CV can be found at [CV](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/eeff0a81b7bc4ffabbfe/). My research focuses on biomedical informatics, including but not limited to BioNLP, knowledge graph, genomics and proteomics. I also own experiences in computer vision, medical imaging and continual learning. My ultimate goal is to build a large-scale intelligent health system. 

I'm currently seeking for Ph.D. positions in biomedical informatics or computational biology. I'm also a highly cooperative researcher. You are more than welcome to contact me if you want to know more about me or collaborate with me.
